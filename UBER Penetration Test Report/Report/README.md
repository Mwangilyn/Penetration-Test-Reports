## üß≠ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Mwangi Cybersecurity performed a passive security evaluation of UBER's infrastructure from *July 24‚Äì27, 2025*.

### üîç Critical Observations
Recent analysis uncovered severe weaknesses risking data compromise, operational disruption, and brand erosion.  
Urgent remediation is required to maintain compliance and customer trust.

### üß® Primary Vulnerabilities

| Issue | Business Impact |
|-------|-----------------|
| *Deprecated Protocols* | Interception of credentials/payment data via SSLv2/v3/TLS 1.0. Attackers could exploit this to intercept sensitive data. |
| *Weak Encryption* | Brute-force decryption of confidential transmissions, enabling data theft. |
| *Invalid Certificates* | Browser trust warnings ("Connection not private"), expiring soon. |
| *Hostname Mismatch* | Certificates do not match domain name, enabling impersonation attacks. |

### ‚úÖ Immediate Actions
- Disable legacy protocols; enforce TLS 1.2+  
- Upgrade encryption standards  
- Replace self-signed certificates with CA-issued trust chain  
- Implement automated certificate renewal  

---

## ‚ö† BUSINESS IMPACT

| Risk Area | Potential Consequences |
|------------|------------------------|
| *Data Breaches* | Customer data theft ‚Üí lawsuits, regulatory fines, revenue loss |
| *Service Disruption* | Browser warnings or expired certificates block users |
| *Compliance Violations* | PCI DSS non-compliance could lead to penalties |
| *Reputational Damage* | Loss of customer trust and competitive edge |

---

## üéØ SCOPE

### Permitted Assets
- All uber.com / ubereats.com subdomains  
- Public APIs (developer.uber.com)  
- Mobile apps (static analysis only)

### Approved Techniques
- Passive OSINT (Recon-ng, DNS queries)  
- Public data review (GitHub, breach databases)  
- Non-intrusive checks (banner grabbing)

### Out of Scope
- Active scanning / brute-forcing  
- Social engineering  
- DoS attacks  
- Third-party services (AWS / Cloudflare)

*Authorized Testing Boundaries:* Uber‚Äôs HackerOne Program  
*Test Conducted By:* Lynette Mwangi

---

## üß™ METHODOLOGY

### Methodology Framework
1. *PTES Phase 1:* Scope validation via HackerOne policy review  
2. *Information Gathering:* Google Dorking  
3. *Passive OSINT:* Subdomain enumeration, DNS analysis  
4. *Public Data Mining:* Breach DBs, GitHub, SSL certs  
5. *Passive Tooling:* Recon-ng (certificate_transparency, resolve)

### Tools Used
- *Recon-ng:* hackertarget, certificate_transparency, resolve
- *OWASP OSINT:* DNS mapping, crt.sh
- *DNS Recon:* dig, nslookup
- *Wappalyzer:* Tech stack analysis
- *GitHub Scraping & Breach Repositories*

### Constraints
- Zero active interaction with UBER systems  
- Ethical boundaries: public data only

## üßÆ RISK RANKING

### Risk Rating Methodology

| Risk | Description | Time to Remediate |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| *Critical* | Full system compromise or data exposure | 24‚Äì48 hours |
| *High* | Privilege escalation or significant disruption | 5‚Äì8 business days |
| *Medium* | Limited access requiring conditions to exploit | 10‚Äì15 business days |
| *Low* | Minor or low-likelihood weaknesses | 30 days |
| *Informational* | Non-exploitable but informative issues | Regular review |

### Rating Matrix

| Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Example |
|-------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| High | High | Critical | Exposed admin panels |
| Medium | High | High | Unpatched CVEs |
| Low | High | Medium | Predictable email formats |

---

## üï∏ FINDINGS AND EVIDENCE

### Infrastructure Exposure
- 415 subdomains ‚Üí Low risk  
- 481 public IPs ‚Üí Low risk  
- DNS hosted on UltraDNS ‚Üí Informational  

### Web Technology Stack (via Wappalyzer)
| Category | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|
| *Analytics* | Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics GA4, Hotjar, Microsoft Clarity, TikTok Pixel |

| *PaaS* | Amazon Web Services |
| *Reverse Proxy* | Envoy |
| *Authentication* | Google Sign-in |
| *Performance* | Priority Hints |
| *Customer Data* | Tealium |

### Infrastructure & Operations

| Finding | Evidence | Risk |
|----------|-----------|------|
| DNS hosted on UltraDNS | dig +short NS uber.com | Informational |
| MX: Google Workspace | dig +short mx uber.com | Informational |
| Employee emails in GitHub commits | Example screenshot | Medium |

---

### üö® Critical Findings
| Issue | Description | Severity |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Employee emails in breaches | GitHub commits | Critical |
| Public S3 bucket (uber-staging-backups) | Unrestricted access | Critical |
| Apache 2.4.41 vulnerabilities | CVE-2020-11984 | High |
| Historical breach data | 2016 incident | Medium |

---

## üõ° RECOMMENDATIONS FOR UBER SECURITY POSTURE

### Critical (0‚Äì7 Days)
- Enforce *FIDO2 MFA* and password reset  
- Secure public S3 buckets (access logging, key rotation)

### High (30 Days)
- Disable BASIC auth ‚Üí migrate to *OAuth 2.0*  
- Conduct vendor security audits  

### Medium/Low (90 Days)
- Server hardening (disable Apache signatures)  
- Subdomain monitoring (ChaosDB / OWASP Amass)  
- Implement API rate limiting and mandatory keys  

### Strategic Initiatives

| Initiative | Purpose | Timeline |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Dark web monitoring | Alert on credential leaks | Continuous |
| Bug bounty expansion | Include mobile & cloud | Q3 2025 |
| Third-party pentests | Annual audits | Annual |
